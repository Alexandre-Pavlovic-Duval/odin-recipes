        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> <strong>Four-cheese pizza</strong> is a type of pizza whose distinctive feature is the use of a combination 
            of <strong><em>four types of cheese</em></strong>, usually melted together.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Mozzarella</li>
            <li>Fontina </li>
            <li>Grana Padano</li>
            <li>HGorgonzola</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the flour and the dry baker's yeast to a large bowl — mix them together so they brewer's yeast is evenly dispersed in the flour.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, dissolve the malt in warm water, add it to the bowl with the flour, together with olive oil and salt.</li>
            <li>Knead by hand until you get a smooth dough.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, then cover it with cling film and store it in a warm spot for 3-4 hours, or until tripled in volume.</li>
            <li>Once risen, divide the dough in half, shape each half in a ball, roll them out into discs on a floured surface, then place each in a non-stick tray and let them rise for another hour.</li>
            <li>Once an hour has passed, sprinkle the pizza base with the four cheeses and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake in a 250°C/480°F oven, with the grill option turned on, for 15 minutes, until the pizza's edges are golden and its bottom dry.</li>
            <li>Once baked, serve immediately.</li>
